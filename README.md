# Predicting Heart Disease

[go straightaway to the results](https://github.com/jasperquak/predicting_heart_disease/blob/main/PredictingHeartDisease.ipynb)

In this project I built a model to predict heart disease based on multiple features, using a file containing (anonymous) data of 918 patients. Data exploration and analysis, feature selection and tuning of the k-nearest neighbor classification model are the key elements of the work. 

This project was a 'guided project' as part of learning data science with [Dataquest](https://www.dataquest.io).

## Results

To display the result, simply [click the .ipynb file](https://github.com/jasperquak/predicting_heart_disease/blob/main/PredictingHeartDisease.ipynb) in this repository. It will open in a Notebook viewer.

## Reproduction

In case you want to reproduce the project in a Jupyter Notebook in your own environment.

Download both the .ipynb file and heart.csv into the same folder.

Before starting Jupyter Notebook, ensure that you have the following packages installed:
* pandas
* numpy
* seaborn
* matplotlib.pyplot

* sklearn.metrics
* sklearn.model_selection
* sklearn.neighbors
* sklearn.preprocessing

## About the data source

The data that is used in this project was downloaded from [a page on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction).
